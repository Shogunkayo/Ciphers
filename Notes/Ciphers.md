# CIPHERS
---
- Algorithm to encrypt and decrypt data 
- Mainly 2 types
1. Transposition ciphers keep all the original bits of data in a byte but mix their order.
2. Substitution ciphers replace specific data sequences with other data sequences. For example, one type of substitution would be to transform all bits with a value of 1 to a value of 0

## Eras of Cryptography
---
Early ciphers were designed to allow encryption and decryption by hand , while those used today are only possible  due to high computational performance

### 1. Classical Ciphers
- [[Atbash]]
- [[RO13]]
- [[Caesar]]
- [[Affine]]
